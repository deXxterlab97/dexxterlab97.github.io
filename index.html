<p>Railroad</p>

<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;I still can't believe you pulled a gun on Frank. That was epic.</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong>&nbsp;It felt awful... I'm glad there was no bullets in there--</p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;You can just rewind time in your hand and stick that barrel right up Frank's ass! You have the power!</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong>&nbsp;You're gross. Don't fall.</p>
<p><em>Max and Chloe briefly hold hands, then let go.</em></p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;I'm just glad you were here.</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong>&nbsp;Me too...I think. Chloe, why the hell are you hanging around scary losers like Frank? It's weird.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;Let's take a break and I'll talk.</p>
<p><em>Max and Chloe lie down on the train tracks.</em></p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;Feels like a different world, huh? I wish we could stay forever...</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong>&nbsp;Can we build another pirate fort and keep the world out?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;We need a new secret hangout... At least Frank wouldn't find us... Are you okay, Max?</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong>&nbsp;I'm still freaked out about what happened... That was awful, Chloe.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;I'm sorry. But Frank isn't as hardcore as he fronts. All he cares about is his cash, stash, and mangy dog.</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong>&nbsp;Chloe, did you see what just happened? I almost shot him! I know I could rewind, but, Chloe, this is not playtime. No more guns.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;Max, I know. Crazy shit is the new normal for me. That's why I planned to leave Arcadia Bay without paying Frank off...</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong>&nbsp;Now, tell me exactly what's going on between you and Frank--does he have a last name?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;Frank Bowers. He's just a dealer. Where I get my weed. The one in your joint, remember? Anyway, Frank and I kind of hung out.</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong>&nbsp;Hung out? You don't mean you...</p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;No, we didn't have sex. Gross, man. He never even tried. I just made the mistake of borrowing money so Rachel and I could bail outta here...</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong>&nbsp;That's it?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;No. I want to know how Frank got Rachel's bracelet... What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong>&nbsp;I think we have to be careful. And keep an eye on this guy. Without him eyeballing us, okay?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;It's so weird talking to you about this insane crap. We haven't hung out this much since we were tweens...and it's like no time has passed. I wish Rachel was here to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong>&nbsp;Do you think that Rachel and I would have been friends?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;You're not that different. She had--has a great eye for images and for art. Plus, she's a smartass like you. We would all be hella best friends forever.</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong>&nbsp;I know she must be as cool as you are. I have no doubt we'll meet soon.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;Railroad tracks always make me feel better...I have no idea why...</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong>&nbsp;Kerouac knew. It's the romance of travel and movement...the sound of the train whistle at night...</p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;Look at the beat poet here.</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong>&nbsp;I'd rather be a good photographer...</p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;You are. You just have to stop being afraid...</p>
<p><em>Max gets up to take a picture of the mid-morning sun framed by the structure of a nearby water tower.</em></p>
<p><strong>Max (thinking):</strong>&nbsp;Perfect...</p>
<p><em>Max holds her head in her hand as the flashing visions of the tornado return. The vision ends with Chloe calling for help.</em></p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;Max!</p>
<p><em>We see Max holding her head in pain as she comes out of the vision to discover Chloe is actually calling for help.</em></p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;Max? Help! I'm stuck!</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong>&nbsp;Hold on, Chloe!</p>
<p><em>Max grabs Chloe's hands and tries to pull her up from the tracks but it doesn't work. She tries to free Chloe's boot, but it is caught in the track switch, which had moved at some point during the vision. Max hears a train horn in the distance.</em></p>
<p><strong>Max (thinking):</strong>&nbsp;What's that noise? The train...oh, shit!</p>
<p><em><u>If Max tries to speak to Chloe</u></em></p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;Get me outta here Max!</p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;Find something! Free me!</p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;I don't wanna die here!</p>
<p><em>Max pulls Chloe out of the train's way just before it reaches them.</em></p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong>&nbsp;Damn, that was close.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;You saved me again! Crazy. Now we're totally bonded for life!</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong>&nbsp;You okay?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;I've got splinters in my ass and leg, so I wish there was a less violent way for you to save me...And now the trains can't get to the lumber mill...Oops.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;Aren't you glad I took you away to a nice quiet, desolate spot?</p>
<p><em>Chloe and Max hug as they walk back along the tracks.</em></p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong>&nbsp;It was cool to spend time in your lair, but...I have to get back to school before my next class...</p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;Since you're the mysterious superhero, I'll be your faithful chauffeur and companion.</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong>&nbsp;My powers might not last, Chloe...</p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;That's okay&mdash;we will. Forever.</p>
<p><em>Chloe drives Max to the entrance of Blackwell. The weather has begun to get rainy.</em></p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks for the ride, Chloe. Right on time for my art lesson.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks for coming with me. Sorry to be so boring...</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong>&nbsp;Nothing exciting ever happens to us, right?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;Listen, your rewind power has to be connected to that snow yesterday. That might explain your tornado vision...</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong>&nbsp;Explain what? Snow equals a ginormous twister that takes out Arcadia Bay? You're high.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;Wake up, Max. You saved my life twice now. You altered the course of my destiny, yours, and whoever! Do you know about Chaos Theory?</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong>&nbsp;Uh...it means "shit happens," right?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;No, "crazy shit happens." Because it can. And will.</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong>&nbsp;Why me? I'm just a geek girl in some small town...</p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;A perfect example of "strange attractors." Don't they teach you kids anything at Blackwell? We have a tornado, rewind power, and freak snow...hello, Armageddon! So let's party with your power, rock star!</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong>&nbsp;Like you said, Professor Price: a superhero needs a sidekick.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe:</strong>&nbsp;How can it be such a shitty week and yet one of the best of my life?</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong>&nbsp;Because we're back in action again!</p>
<p><em>The pair high-five and bump fists before Max exits the truck. Max waves goodbye as Chloe drives away.</em></p>
